Probably do the client in curses

Possibly a GUI for the n00bs out there too (in Tk)

synical: i tried writing a basic client that just connected and automatically
sent a message but it crashed both the clietn and the server :D maybe something
to talk about :D

hyperfunk: i think the basic functionality is in there now. Clients can connect
and disconnect as they please and all seems to function ok.
